Hello-World

First Git Repo Ever


Description:
I have used git through source tree in my work at Elavon, and now I want to figure out how to do it with command lines.

This is my first addition from the command line in VI

Step 0
This is actually step 4, but please read step 3.

Step 1
Lemme add some crap, then go to the command line, then save this here, then try pushing from the command line.

Step 2
I'm in the command line, step 1 is currently invisible

Step 3
I'm going to see if I can add stuff in a completely separate location. Step 0 does not currently exist, so I will see if I can commit these without issues / conflicts

Step 4
I'm adding from test branch
